22	Our Creator established rules governing marriage long before governments began regulating the institution. The opening book of the Bible tells us: “A man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24) The Hebrew word “wife,” according to Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words, “connotes one who is a female human being.” Jesus confirmed that those yoked together in marriage should be “male and female.”—Matthew 19:4.

49	"I don't see the problem in the idea. Speaking as lecurer of 16-19 year olds in the subject of health and social care, there is a radical difference between their generation and mine with regards to acceptance (and not just tolerance) of non-hetrosexual cisgender people and issues. I bring it up constantly in my teaching and have a significant number of case study issues that bring up sexuality and gender in younger and older case studies. They are, most of the time, very ""okay"" with it and get quite affronted with inequality. I am of the view that in the future, such an instituation will start to become null void as a ""requirement"" - the future generation will embrace this. But I'm being hopeful."

110	Yes, you can have special homes built for the LBG community. I want homes for people who are interesting and intelligent, don't swear. We can have other homes for Black people, Asian people, disabled people. Lots and lots of homes just tailor made for me and me not forgetting me. We are all human beings whatever our sexual orientation. I suppose it will take many years for the LBG community to have the confidence to accept themselves and not feel the need to keep reminding us of their sexual preferences and orientation. Those who don't accept the LBG community will find it lonely in their old age because they will be in the minority. I'm 73 and hope I never end up in a home. The thought isn't a pleasant one for me and when we are well and fit isn't for anybody. If I do have to then I hope I will be able to enjoy good conversation and laughter with whoever is sitting next to me whatever their sexual orientation and still have the compassion to listen.

168	What does the word Humanity mean? It means to love, to care, to show compassion, to practice and preach helping each other in our emotional and physical times of distress. To show acceptance and respect towards each other as fellow living beings (for all living beings). These essential and natural elements of humanity existed and come to existence much before man made ideas, practices, beliefs and expectations (religions, societies, mythologies, ideologies, etc.) A child of any species first takes birth as a living being, belonging to him/her/it self first and foremost later on the families, societies, communities and ourselves start identifying with something or the other- in most cases it's a clever imposition. This child that takes birth as itself is taking birth as a living being and the only thing it truly belongs to is it's own inner light- inner compassion, inner love and humanity. Today in the USA, Humanity has won over regressive ideas, beliefs, emotions and feelings of hatred, disrespectfulness, segregation and discrimination. Congratulations to us all to be a part of a society and country that believes in 'Inclusion' and not 'exclusion'. We need to understand everything in nature, is Natural! Now that the LGBTQ community has been embraced with open arms and humanity, we should make attempts and take strong steps in providing equality to other minority groups or groups being sidelined- we should open ourselves towards understanding and embracing groups belonging to all skin colors (African Americans, Asians, Caucasians, etc.), genders, mental and physical limitations, animals rights, children's rights, etc. A historical day in the U.S. and the world today.

Why cant they choose to be themselves in such a place rather than having to hide or getting comments like 'i'm not sitting next to that queer' etc in a classic establishment.. if they want to choose to live there let them and give them a ducking break in their twilight years!

286	"Carolina, people like you love to try and take the ""oh I use logic and the left just have insults"" line. Would you like to know why everyone is insulting you? Would you even be open to comprehending the motivation? How many conversations do you think we've had, in real life and in the cyber world, about our rights to exist? Conversation about how we want to be treated like everyone else (that is to say, love the ones we love, whether it looks like yours or not, marry who we want to, whether our choice in partner is what YOU and people like you would approve of), or to be able to exist without fear of an individual having real animosity towards us and doing something about it and being surrounded in those moments by people like *you*, who ""don't hate us"" but would be passive enough to keep us marginalized. How many? Have a guess? The point is, your ""science"" is flawed, and we've heard it all before. Your ""logic"" is hopelessly idiotic, and we've heard it all before. Your ""reason"" isn't fully fleshed out at all, and obviously has way more to do with emotion (ironic that, but not unexpected) than anything even remotely reasonable, and we've HEARD it ALL before. But can we convince one such as you if any of that? Mostly, given history, nah. We can't. Cause you're ignorant, and people like you in the past have wanted nothing so much as to stay that way. Final note, a suggestion. If you'd like *not* to be insulted, try having options that aren't garbage. I hear it works wonders."	Other offensive	Offensive	Commenter	lgbt

Even though I am hetero, I am not interested in a relationship but have had so many problems with men who live in neighbouring flats. This is very difficult so I would like women only, but why should I have to live apart from the males of society because some want to be difficult.

God also orders the destruction of 60 cities so that the Israelites can live there. He orders the killing of all the men, women, and children of each city, and the looting of all of value (Deuteronomy 3).

Also, I feel like it has to be pointed out, having a mental illness isn't a ""bad"" thing, it's not some insult, it's a harsh reality, a reality that requires some level of care and understanding.

One day, any one of us will be, if we're lucky to get there. Respect them. Being segregated in a home is bad enough. Shame.	Acceptable speech	Acceptable	No target	lgbt

I wouldn't want to be in a place where people discriminated against me for say being conservative and voting Brexit but ah, that would be OK wouldn't it. Sorry my best friend is gay and I love gay men. I also feel for transsexual people. I wouldn't like to be in a place where people swore every other word or who were crude but that's just how I feel. I hope I never need to be in an institution but people are lonely from all walks of life not just in one very small section of society.

What your first comment failed to understand is that being LGBT is not just about sex, it's about who we love and how we have lived our lives. I don't want myself or anyone else to have to go back into the closet because of fear on old age. Yes, in time attitudes will, are and have changed BUT even if all was perfect I have lived my life surrounded by my LGBT community and I would like to continue to have the chance to do so. We have a shared life experience as a community that will probably be even more valuable to me as I grow older. We make decisions about who we live with when we are adults, why should we have this taken away and treated like children when we are older? I also think many will take issue with you on ""sexuality going down the pan"" when you are old - is that your lived experience or are you projecting your feeling for a cause?"

I am not bothered by whatever you say afterall you have no input into civilization except that you keep feeding it with filth just because God has brought about your existence and all you will do is struggle against what He has enjoined the entire humanity to shun. And now that you have decided not to do that, then wait for His response; wait, and it shall come upon you sooner than you think... And for those of you who think God does not exist and that your creation is by coincidence, you too should also wait until your appointed time also elapses and you shall see clearly everything you used to deny.

Judges 11:29-40 29 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites. 30 And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: “If you give the Ammonites into my hands, 31 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.” 32 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands. 33 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon. 34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.” 36 “My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the Lord. Do to me just as you promised, now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites. 37 But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.” 38 “You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. 39 After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin.From this comes the Israelite tradition 40 that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.

841	Judges 21:10-24New International Version (NIV) 10 So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children. 11 “This is what you are to do,” they said. “Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.” 12 They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan. 13 Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon. 14 So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them. 15 The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel. 16 And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left? 17 The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 18 We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’ 19 But look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.” 20 So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards 21 and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin. 22 When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’” 23 So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them. 24 At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.

848	Thank you Neil for asking this question ! Unlike some people who pounced on me because I expressed my opinion freely although many people totally disagree with gay marriage & supposedly their opinions must be respected too ! Anyhow , homosexuaity is aberration , and homosexual behavior isn't natural for those so oriented . The orientation is a disroder and the behavior is pathological . Sexual preferance is cultural & environmental rather than genetic . There is a broad agreement that genes don't make it & genetic influence at most is minor . Individualistic reactions to random factors are very important . For example , divorce doubles the risk of later homosexuality in children . So social & family paths lead to it & the environment is much more powerful than genes in the development of homosexuality . Here , homosexuals are the victims of environmental problems and they are like patients who should get proper treatment .	Background offensive	Offensive	Topic	lgbt

985	Jane and Lee. There's a couple of things. 1. People's sexual habits are quite a small part of their sexuality. There is a history, a culture, a vocabulary all born from oppression which is part of our individual and collective identity as an LGBT community. When you reduce someones identity to sex you objectify them and begin to dehumanise them. It's a common mistake and one that many LGBT people make as well, but try to think of this articles in terms of people's experience rather than their sex lives. 2. There is a common oppressive discourse that gay people (men specifically) are peadophiles. I know you're not suggesting this in your reference to peadophilia but even using the term in the same sentence implies a connection. That is oppressive, if you don't want to offend LGBT people stop referring to peadophiles in any context wen talking about LGBT people. 3. Straight people don't need to come out, everyone presumes your straight, be thankful for this. Coming out is scary and sometimes has a negative result for the person doing the coming out. 4. Getting on with our lives and living and let living is not about ignoring difference, it's about celebrating diversity. So pretending homophobia doesn't exist and 'we are all in it together' is difficult for people that have experienced oppression.

96	"Well, wherever I'm from, please justify how I'm racist? That's a nice argument coming from someone trying to muddy the waters between refugees and ""illegal immigrants"", I note with interest you haven't taken issue with my comments about Bulgarians... You'll note I also said ""most Europeans"" and compared refugees with professional beggars... you really should be careful about overreaction. For your information I'm an internationalist and see no reason for any borders (incidentally, neither do the rich or corporations, so why should the poor suffer them?) Yet again, you need a lesson in terminology and are missing the concept of refugee status. Immigrants are usually given indefinite leave to remain or a contractual period of time, refugees (such as the syrians coming to canada) will be given temporary leave to remain, and will as such be expected to return home as/when Syria is ""safe"". Syrians are not safe from war in Turkey, or have you missed the stories of multiple suicide bombings and revenge army attacks? Plus there's the point Turkey has as many refugees as the EU in a much smaller area... they're pushing on the Christian and Kurdish refugees. It's not schizophrenic, ""refugee"" is a legal term and Germany & Sweden have offered to take all Syrianss fleeing war. Hence, despite the legalities of entering Greece, as soon as they're registered they are legally refugees... until then let's say asylum seekers, as no one fleeing war or persecution shouldbe branded ""illegal"". As for Greece, Olga, sorry while I was attempting to prise a reaction from mr anonymous teacher there, i have nothing against Greeks, Bulgarians or Romanians per se, many Europeans do, and Bulgaria has elected a rather right-wing govt... Mr greek, As for dealing with these refugees, I do every week at work, and they're a friendly bunch that I've so far met... Vienna racist? :-D so the ""fluchtlinge wilkommen"" movement hasn't been reported then? While we're on the subject of history/historical places, shall we touch on the reasons the middle east is a shit storm now? Post WW1 the allies carved up the ottoman empire and drew lines in the earth to force people together in some areas where they hated each other, and apart in others where they potentially threatened western interests.... Cyprus is the largest testament to the active part the Greeks played in that theatre. Meanwhile, my family were enjoying a civil war in the Irish free state... easy to chuckaround labels, isn't it?

101	No, we don't think that Hungary is expert in anything, except in building fences and spreading xenophobia. The problem originated from the lack of proper control at border crossing between Turkey and Greece. When the migrants have entered the EU there, it is only a matter of time when will they end where they want and there is no way to get them back to Syria now. Army and fences will solve nothing. Only a plan on the EU level with the exact quotas for each country can solve the problem. Nationalism, racism, and widespread xenophobia, as promoted by PM Orban will make things only worst.

122	"the comments which come from brains of advocates of murder in the name of ""our country"" and ""our problems"" ignore the fact that development and migration are intrinsically related, that the capitalist system inherently develops unevenly, that the British regime is part and parcel of economic policies imposed on poor countries through various means (IMF, World Bank, support of dictatorships, freedom of their corporations to plunder, etc, etc), that the same regimes have played a significant role in aborting the attempt of the same people fleeing ""their countries"" in overthrowing the oppressive system at home (see the so-called Arab Spring, the elections, the NGOs, etc) all in order to maintain the status quo. Then you wonder why people flee and drown in the sea. It's the failure of a certain capitalist modality in large swathes of the world. Capital, a thing, is free to migrate anywhere, but humans are not. so, thank you all of you, bunch of murder apologists and defenders of your own oppressive barbaric regime in Britain. instead of attacking the Regime here and its criminality against its own population you are finding a scapegoat as it is an easy target demonstrating your complicity in barbarism."

So 7k are placed in my city and state & the crime is immeasurable. Child killings, torture & abductions are higher than ever. Heroin & needle deali dealing is everywhere. Muggings, home invasions and school violence is uncontrollable and domestic violence, well its all day everyday.

130	Not really. There's 2.5 million that entered a Greece of a 10 million population in a very short year and a half, with a much as half a million arriving in the last few months spine, accounting for 1/4th of its population all on small islands with towns half that of the size of Moncton. That's like saying by analogy 10 million people came to Canada all within a few months in the smallest of towns. If that had happened here, you'd be crying like a petty spoiled whiner that you are for not being able to drive through the streets. So stop being naive. This is as much a crisis for the illegal immigrants as it is for those locals whose lives they are destroying. You have it easy, and you pick and choose sides too easily based on your preconceived notions. There's utter chaos in these circumstances and nothing is cut and dry. What is more, there's evidence these people are being urged to immigrate into Europe instead of dispersing in the surrounding vicinity of their country that is safe and where they are welcome and where they don't have to travel for 1800 km and pay smugglers 5 thousands euros per head to get to Europe when they're not even running away from danger any longer. Worse yet, countries like UAE, which are Muslim, wealthier than Germany and Greece and Italy and France combined, and a mere 200 km away from Syria have closed their borders to their Muslim brothers. To give you a sense of how irrationally wild it is that they specifically want to come to Greece, get this: Iraq is roughly the same distance: 1890 km from Greece. Where are all the Iraqis from the war there? What about all the Palestinians? They are closer. What about all the Egyptians? They could have just skipped over the sea onto Crete when there was war in their country, but hardly anyone came. What about people from Jordan, they are closer too. Where are they? Libyans didn't come to Greece either. So what's up with Syrians? They are neither the first nor the last to have war. What's the deal with this mass exodus of only males? When the war in Bosnia took place, none came to Greece and they are much much closer by a few hundred km. When the war in Kosovo broke out, no one came either nor dispersed into Europe. When the war in Ukraine came, hardly any mass migration took place. When the war in Yugoslavia took place that created FYROM and the such, hardly anyone moved about yet again. The scenario with Syrians is a first in recent history. Don't be so naive. All these men are draft dodgers too. They should be fighting for their country as they are able bodied, young and healthy. Who will rebuild their nation. At best I find this mass exodus suspiciously curious for destabilizing both Syria and Europe.

How they acted was inappropriate. That being said, there is another side to this religion. I have seen that side as well. To ignore that side is ignorance itself. It's where Islam converges with Western beliefs. The result from that is actually very calm. Anyone who is like those in the video are in the wrong, I agree. We don't need those people. It causes chaos. But anyone who only focuses on that side is just as wrong. Muslim values can be compatible with Western values. You just have never seen it, or perhaps don't want to, but I have.

After 4 years, 87% of syrians are unemployed. 9 groups are more criminal than the average. 8 of them are muslim. Even corrected for socio-economics. So in reality it is much worse.

They entered the EU in Greece; 3. They were invited by Ms Merkel; 4. Hungary build walls. The law says that the refugees should be registered in the country they enter first. This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece. Where they registered there? No! EU law? Is there anywhere in the EU law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? No. And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. In the light of my points 1 to 4, all refugees heading for Germany should stay in Croatia and Serbia, because Hungary decided to build walls. Croatia is not acting in accordance with the law simply because Greece and Hungary decided to breach it first. You have no right invoking the law when you are breaching law also.

They control the prices the farmers charge, the prices the clothing manufactures charge, the prices the electrical manufactures charge and so on and in turn they control what you pay and buy and how you buy and how you pay.

I don't mind people coming to this country from other countries as long as they have the money to fund themselves over here. If we went to another country we would have to have enough money to live for at least 5 years and wouldn't get any benefits from those countries either. If we didn't have the money then we wouldn't get in it's as simple as that. ALSO we need to add boundaries like if they have a criminal record no way would they get in, if they don't have the job specifications they wouldn't get in also that they would get NO benefits whatsoever for a minimum of 5 years (like Australia) and then you would only get benefits after the 5 year point if you have been working for those 5 years and you get basic benefits at that point and the longer you have worked the more you would be entitled too. If we brought in all those stipulations I would be fine with whoever came into this country as then I would know that they are not a drain on our economy. We are too nice to other minorities in this country and forget about our own people and their needs. We need to put our own people first and the other minorities second. ALSO we need to stop giving them monies for their children that are not even in this country also!!!!! EVERY minority that comes to this country should not be entitled to any free NHS, NO money from DSS, NO free housing etc they are the ones wanting to come to this country it's not as if we are begging them to come here so they can claim benefits it is their choice and most come to this country (NOT ALL) only want to come to the UK because of everything they get when they arrive.

260	I realise that I look at things dfferently to others so here's my humble thoughts ... another way of looking at things. I am a mental health clinician and have contact with asylum seekers. I also see the struggles they have. These people want their home lands and their families, they don't want to be westernised and their culture made irrelevant. Many also suffer from PTSD and suffer on a daily basis. I had one man who was suicidal because he was unable to provide for his family in his home country and he could not contact family in UN camps apart from one member whom he was told would not be leaving the camp. This man cannot fit into a foreign society and do all he needs to to do this successfully when he cannot cope with his immense loss. IMHO I sincerely think we need to stop looking at these situations from our own points of reference and look at them from their perspective. What do they want and need. It's not being displaced and moved to foreign lands with little to no family. You see, cultures outside of western influence appear to value family relationships much more than we do. Look around us at our neighbours - the only extended families are those immigrants who could afford to come her and wanted to. Instead of putting a bandage on a haemorrhage, why don't we fix the problem. Instead of spending all that money to resettle people all around the world, why don't governments join together to despose those in power and causing this crisis. It wold make more sense to get rid of the problem and let people live in their country with their culture and family. I have much more thought on this but this is the gist of it. At the end of the day we westerners do what we would want, maybe we should ask what they want and need. cheers	Acceptable speech	Acceptable	No target	migrants

Delina: i think the most important thing you have to question is whether muslims believe that these things you mentioned apply today or whether they apply at all. 1. The whole muhammad marrying Aysha at the age of 9 is debated heavily within the muslim community itself. Some say she wasn’t 9. Even if she was we need to remember that we are talking about 1,400 years ago where there are numerous cases of such things happening within that region. Most importantly, do muslims marry 9 year olds. Rarely. I’ve only heard of cases in Egypt and Saudi. So muslims do not agree with this and it rarely occurs. 2. Nearly all muslims believe that the whole slavery thing is misinterpreted. People interpret it as during war when you come across women do not make them the untouchables and that you should marry them if you want (marriage in the quran requires both consents) and treat them equally. With regards to other slaves, muslims believe that their prophet brought a lot of new rights to salves, changing the roman slavery rules. In addition, a lot of slaves were freed. A lot of the things I have read confirm this. 3. The whole marrying 4 i think was there to spread Islam. I have never come across anyone in my life that has married more than 1 and tbh it only happens in some societies like Saudia Arabia. Nearly all muslims marry 1 person. So again applicable then and not now. 4.Women rights. The whole covering your self completely is simply incorrect. Quran requires you to be modest and not for full out covering. It’s more of a culture thing (or should i say a tribal thing) plus people used to wear it for protection from the sand. I am not joking when I say this but during my 13 years in Baghdad i saw less burkas than in my 3 years in London. In the society I lived in, all my friends' muslim moms went to uni, had jobs and lived equally to men. Within the same families you can find women covering their hair and some that don't. Different interpretation of modesty. This is in Iraq, UAE and the UK. Saudi Arabia is not how the majority of muslim women live and really does not represent Islam. FGM for example again only happens in some societies and not across the muslim world. In fact its mostly an african thing and happens a lot in non-muslim countries. 5. Your statement that muslims have only brought misery to the west is a bit extreme. you have put Sunnis, Shias, Alawites, Whabasim, Ahmadeyia, Druze and many others all in one group. Muslim immigration has worked wonderfully in some situations and haven’t worked in other situations. This depends on a lot of factors such as the people coming to the west, the people receiving the immigrants, the programs in place to connect both. For examples, there are so so many muslims in the NHS. If we are going through the route of blaming the whole group then the middle east can say the same about the west. The west has only brought misery to the middle east, from the Sykes-Picot agreement, to the overthrow of the Iranian government in 1953, to supporting Saddam, supporting Al qaeda against the russions, illegally occupying Iraq, supplying weapons to the Syrian rebels, giving weapons to Qaddafi and then taking him out and supporting countries with extreme ideologies. How many dictators have the west supported? Should we block all the west from entering the middle east. Should we build walls around every country in the world. So the misconception people have with Islam is to do with the Quran. Do muslims apply certain verses to their everyday life or do they think that some verses only apply to the past with some parts being story telling. The quran is in arabic, written 1,400 years ago, so are we interpreting the quran correctly? I am sure how things were said 1400 years ago is different to how we speak now. In my experience, most of the muslims i know, and I know a lot given that i used to live in Iraq and the UAE, agree that some versers are not applicable today or they interpret those verses differently. David I couldn’t watch your video for some reason.	Acceptable speech	Acceptable	No target	migrants

309	I don't think the threat to Europe is going to be from refugees coming in from Iraq or Syria. If ISIS manages to blow something up in the UK it will be a British or another EU national who will be carrying out these activities. I would assume that any refugee coming in the country would have some tight surveillance on them. What ISIS wants is division because that works in their favour. The more division the easier it is to convince people that there is a big difference between us and them. The more hate crime the more the propaganda will work. So what we can do is show how ridicilous ISIS and other radical groups are. A school program will have to be included in school to teach muslims and non-muslims how groups like ISIS are at crossroads with Islamic teachings. The majority of people killed by ISIS are muslim and they are burning muslim town after town in Syria. Also programs outside school are needed to educate muslims and non-muslims about Islam and to clarify certain scriptures that are causing confusing. Such programs have already started but of course we need to see more. Muslims have been a lot more active in explaining to others about Islam after recent events. So yes education is key.

310	"Well Will Moreton I don't think there's much conspiracy other than what's flat out under our nose here. I'm neither ""anti-accepting-refugee"" nor ""anti-accepting-immigrant"". I'm ""anti-accepting-illegal-immigrant"" and ""anti-arbitrarily-labeling-illegal-immigrants-as-refugees"". To give you an example: we're bringing 25,000 Syrians into Canada and I'm quite happy about that. The most important thing though is that they will enter legally, with proper checks and naturalization through immigration authorities. So even though the media are having their little jamboree orgasm clasping on the term ""refugees"" into Canada (LOL), they are in veritable truth LEGAL IMMIGRANTS in this case, nonetheless; and whose tragic circumstances justify expedient, albeit legal, immigration should they please to do so. Most importantly, they are NOT seeking refuge into Canada away from war if they are departing from Turkey, unless they are air lifted or ferried straight from Syria, into Canada. In other words, they are NOT refugees even in the case of Canada. Do you find the term ""refugee"" sexier or something compared to ""immigrant""? because the term"" refugee"" applies only in specific contexts and circumstances. Does it connote more compassion in your view or something? Because I find it's being used as a blanket statement to force illegal immigration as something desirable and normal, which it shouldn't. So what exactly is it that you find is being implied as ""conspiracy""?"	Background offensive	Offensive	Topic	migrants

325	Daily Mail (London) reports that a top Iman has told Muslims to use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens and 'conquer their countries'. Sheikh Muhammad Ayed gave the speech at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem claiming Europe was only welcoming refugees as a new source of labour. He said Europe was facing a demographic disaster and urged Muslims to have children with westerners so they could 'trample them underfoot, Allah willing.' Birth rates are far higher in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most migrants are coming from.The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, 'And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.' To move to a new land in order to bring Islam is considered a meritorious GERMANY TODAY REVERSES WHAT MARTEL HAS WON FOR EUROPE. The Battle of Tours 1356, was fought on October 10, 732 between forces under the Frankish leader Charles Martel and a massive invading Islamic army led by Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi Abd al Rahman, near the city of Tours, France. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. This battle stopped the northward advance of Islam from the Iberian peninsula, and is considered by most historians to be of macrohistorical importance, in that it halted the Islamic conquests, and preserved Christianity as the controlling faith in Europe, during a period in which Islam was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires. Now while ISIS is overrunning Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Germany is opening its borders to Syrians, and thereby what Charles Martel achieved for Europe has been made fruitless. These migrants cannot be compared to WWII refugees, for they were Europeans and they had no hidden agenda either to propagate their religion or to indulge in terrorist activities, as Atta & Co., did on 9/11 after enjoying everything in the West.

Based on the fact that less than half are actually refugees it would mean 100-150 thousand this year for Hungary alone. If we do not register them, EU can say the Schengen border is in Austria and they re-introduce strict control, leaving Hungary to accommodate them while they wait.

401	Thanks for your comment and I partially agree with you. I am also glad to see that a conversation is possible even if we have different views. There may be a law against a fence which I dont know about but I doubt that there is. If I am wrong and there is why is there a fence in Calais? If there is no law then Hungary didnt breach the law migrants can still enter the border and go through registration. Prior to this I was also thinking that the problem is in Greece but looking at the situation in Hungary and they sheer amount of people I can see why the fragile Greek economy cannot protect its borders and register people. To be honest they needed help well before this happened. And yes, the fence is not an answer on the long term and I dont think it will be up if the situation can be controlled in any other more sensible ways. However, people break through polce lines and it is physicaly impossible to establlish border control without it. You will soon see that people enter your country getting into Croatian citizens gardens and blocking train stations and motorways and making it impossible for people to go to work for example. Also what is really sad that Hungary has been criticised by Croatia that we were not prepared and Croatia will handle the situation better and look what happened! I still hope that a common solution will be found and neighbourhing countries will not turn on each other. Hungary has been critices left, right and centre without any help from our neighbourghs....

423	The migrants always use babies or little children as shields - should I believe to your version? The behaviour of Hungary is disgraceful. In italy we had migrants for so many years. Every week they come by boats, we shelter them and don't make walls.Many of them die in the water, ordinary people run in the water to save them. We have lot of controversies in ur nation cos many people don't want them to come, but while they land , and are in need, there is nothing else to do then shelter them with humanity, and this is what people in Lampedusa do. Hungarians know it very well as they were migrants htemselves during the period of their need back in the revolution in the 50s. Over 200,000 of them escaped looking for shelter in the western countries and now that few thousands are in need, they build a wall. Look at ho the hungarians were sheltered at that time.

425	Eszter - I will paraphrase a (very long) response I posted on Gergely Dian's comment thread.... Basically everyone has failed eastern Europe. 1) The refugees should not have left the countries they escaped to - the UN should have made sure they stayed in the camps, and were registered. 2) Merkel basically sent out an invite to a free party in Germany, and slammed the door in the faces of people who turned up, because her house was full. 3) With nowhere to go, the refugees were stuck in Hungary, who quickly worked out they couldn't handle the numbers, so did the same as Germany, and stopped them coming in... thus pushing the problem further back down the line. The problem is when you plug one hole in a dam, it doesn't stop the pressure building up, it will just break out somewhere else - like Croatia or Serbia. So Eastern Europe as a whole is in a no-win situation - if you individually keep them out, you are called inhumane, even if you can't cope with the burden. If you decide to let them through, you are technically breaking the law. The solution I proposed was let those already moving go to Germany and register, and ensure those in camps or those leaving Syria stay in the camps and register. The UN will then be able to oversee their rights are upheld (shelter and food - even if that means camps in Germany, Austria etc.), or that the refugees are resettled as appropriate. However the only way that would work is if it is a temporary solution, and the refugees are able, and actively encouraged to return home at the earliest opportunity. {As it happens, the paraphrasing still turned out to be quite long - sorry :) }	Acceptable speech	Acceptable	No target	migrants

463	"As with any issue today, public attitudes regarding Immigration and the EU are being determined by a mixture of general dumbing down and a total lack of attention span. A superficial, knee-jerk prejudice is easy to communicate in the snappy soudbites that the media and twitter has accustomed us to. Responding to those ignorant and misleading messages requires background, knowledge and information and a reasoned, articulated argument. People are just too lazy to read complicated messages these days, so they are naturally attracted to simplistic slogans and soundbites that convince them that issues are simple and the solutions equally simple. There is no such thing as a simple political issue and any politician who promises a ""cure-all"" like leaving the EU is a quack, however much he/she may say the things you like to hear. Anyone who believes that an exit from the EU will resolve more problems than it will create is as self-deluded as they are manipulated. The UK is an attractive country for immigrants because it presents a successful image to the world. The reality is that the UK is no longer a Political or economic power that is strong enough to stand on its own in relation to the massive interests of the US, China or for that matter the EU. The UK, outside the EU would fast become a political irrelevance on the Internatiional scene. Absurdly, it's exactly those naiive and anachronistic flag-waving patriots fighting for 'Britishness' that are least in touch with British culture today. I'm proud to be British, but my pride is linked to our Multi-ethnic culture as a whole and not some lame royal regalia or bowler-hat and pinstripe tourist nonsense. Our Multicultural society is one the few positive consequences of our colonial past, and Britain has every reason to be proud of having achieved the enriched society it has today. Our multicultural society s a far more accurate and rich expression of our Island's historical heritage than red telephone boxes and roast beef. By all means seal yourself off from the world and watch the country slide into irrelevance and economic meltdown, but that will be a consequence the UK would be entirely responsible for and not something you can lay at the door of exploited and marginalized immigrants."

481	You have compared the Hungarian refugees from 1956 to the Syrian refugees. You have called our attention to brush up our memory, now I'd like to ask You to do the same. ;-) In 1956 the Hungarians immediately after crossing the border e.g. to Austria they went to the local authorities and co-operated with them. The Hungarians stayed in the refugee-camp as long as they were ordered to do so and left the camps only when they were allowed to. The Hungarians have used their passports to identify themselves and have accepted the registration process. The Hungarians have left the refugee-camps only to that country which accepted them upon their registration data. The Hungarians did not attack the border/fence/soldiers/policemen etc of other countries but they did everything to follow the rules and traditions of the given foreign country. And at last there were only 200.000 Hungarians, while there are 4.000.000 Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugees do not stay in their neighbour countries but they move toward to other countries upon their guess and without any documents. They cross green borders without permit and they do not want to use the OPEN border stations, although those are OPEN. They do not want themselves to be registrated and do not want to stay in the refugee-camps. Instead of co-operating with the local authorities, they attack the borders and the policemen. They do not stay in refugee-camps and do not accept any help (food, drink etc) from the local authorities and churches but money. They do not use even the provided waste bins, but they simply throw their litter to everywhere. They do not want to follow the local law and traditions but show aggressive behaviour. I accept that their norms are different to ours, and that there is a big cultural difference. But it seems to me that at the present only we (Europeans) act tolerantly while they stick to their rigid customs. It is hard to imagine any real co-operation with them if they do not change their attitude.	Background offensive	Offensive	Topic	migrants

525	"HOW DARE YOU? How dare you? Greeks didn't create any war in the middle east. They haven't in the least bit, neither directly nor indirectly instigated any of the problems facing Syria. Yet Greeks are carrying almost the entire burden of illegal immigration into Europe almost singlehandedly, when in fact the very countries responsible for the crisis in Syria and the middle East in general, including Britain where you're from, which has been a global cancer with its imperialism are doing nothing. Greece hasn't caused this flux of immigrants. Yet Greece is handling almost all of them. But Britain has had a significant involvement in the middle east and Syria to say the least. I think it's only fair to take in a few ""refugees"" from Lesvos island and move them to Britain, to turn your village in Britain into something like you argue Greece deserves (for its politicians being idiots, and causing the crisis, in your logic). I'm glad you told the world what an horrible racist you are by finding an arbitrary excuse based on my name alone to be spewing your hate about Greeks when we're talking about Syrian immigrants and Syrian refugees being incorrectly labeled as such by the media who incorrectly use the terms interchangeably. There are Greeks who have it just as bad, if not worse than some Syrians who can afford 5000 euros to pay their smuggler into Greece, as they live in abject poverty in the streets of Athens, eating from garbage bins and rendered homeless through no fault of their own.

529	"Eszter - I agree with you 100%, in the ideal world. But let's say everyone agrees to implement 100% border control at midnight tonight - with the numbers we are seeing, countries in eastern Europe will struggle to give the aid that is needed (even if the refugees were to behave and abide by the law). That is why I said about letting the ones moving get to Germany - so the burden falls on the country, or countries that can handle it, until the UN takes over. As for genuine refugees vs illegal immigrants... that is another reason to pass the problem on to Germany, because eastern Europe couldn't undertake the burden of repatriating the illegals. The only way to fix the problem is stop the flow at source, and let the rest get to somewhere better equipped. Your second concern (about knowing who is who, and where they are) is a major issue for Europe that I feel will come back to haunt Europe. I believe Hungary have already arrested at least one member of ISIS, so how many more have just disappeared - and even without the terrorist threat, how many ""undesirables"" or criminals have taken the opportunity to simply vanish? As I said before the situation descended into a great big cluster fk - compassion is one thing, but it looks like western Europe totally lost it's mind, and didn't think a single thing through."

597	Shauny... can you explain WHY they should use the word refugee? If you look at the UN definitions, a refugee is a person fleeing somewhere in fear of their lives, and a migrant is someone moving to improve their quality of life (usually to improve their economic position). Now, if we assume we are talking only about the syrians, and not the other people moving through Europe, they are undoubtedly refugees when they leave Syria. However, they then choose NOT to register in the UN camps, or with the authorities of the bordering countries, and they move on. That is when they become migrants - leaving one safe place for another to improve their quality of life. Whether they are entitled to or not is a different issue, I am merely asking why you think they should be called refugees regardless of where they are at the time...

I wonder how your parents and brothers would have reacted if you decided to announce to them you were becoming an atheist, putting a mini skirt on and going to spend a weekend at your boyfriend's house. I have read Quran and its misogyny is transparent. Also women rights are non existent in Muslim countries because they have religious laws, not secular laws. There is a lot of ex Muslim women who were raised in Islam and say the same thing. Also, you have completely ignored my question again.	Background offensive	Offensive	Topic	migrants

641	"Sir, I doubt that people are more accepting of Syrian refugees that Bulgarians and Romanians. Begging is a very big annoying, unpleasant and ultimately harassing thing but you are mistaken if you think that the refugees will integrate quick and without any issues and be forever grateful to their European Savior. They are faced with bureaucracy right now, procedures and this makes them mad and feeling disregarded. They have some high expectations and a very different perception of Europe and what Europe has to offer. The idea that once the refugees together with their families arrive in Austria, Germany, etc they will have a job in a matter of hours/days is unrealistic. The reality of the matter is that the whole process takes time, and after what they have endured they don't have any more patience which is understandable.Contrary to what most of people think most of the refugees will despise their ""European Savior"" if we keep ignoring some core issues and congratulating ourselves for being so accepting."

662	For the west to be longsighted and not support extremists groups at the sake of making money or short term goals. ISIS would not be anywhere as powerful as it is today if western powers didn't illegally occupy iraq and completely remove all army personnel and councillors. Borders were left open and many ex-soldiers started working with al qaeda to fight the occupation. Al qaeda was non existant during Saddam's time. It simply wasn't there. ISIS is an offshoot of al qaeda. The west supported and financed al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. Also the west's attempt of removing bashar by supplying weapons to the ''moderate rebels'' in Syria was just stupid. A lot of these weapons ended up with ISIS making them stronger. We all know that the west supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is the UK's biggest purchaser of weapons. The less powerful ISIS and Al Qaeda are the less propaganda there is to brainwash people with. There are many factors leading to the mess we are in and the west's middle east policy is one factor.

666	Simon, I can see where you are comming from and there is a lot I can agree with you on. I just want to add that if Hungary didn't send the migrants to Germany or put a stop on numbers passing through Hungary by enforcing border controlls nobody would have taken it seriously till to this day. My biggest concern is that according to current estimates only 20-30% of the will get refugee status and those who won't will be asked to return home. I am not sure if you have seen the reaction when people were stopped and asked to register but you could see lots aggression and violence. What will happen when they are encouraged to go home? I can't even imagine their reactions. And will they? The EU is notoriously bad at returning refugees to their country of origin. I am still thinking border control is the way forward but not only in Hungary but all the way along. If we suppose that they can return to their countries after it is safe then refugees must be helped (by the enitre EU) as close to their home as possible. Also it would discourage those who are not running from war to stay at home and dont risks their life. If you cannot protect the border you soon won't be able to protect not even EU citizens but the real refugees who need help. My other problem is that at this stage EU is talking about quotas, migrants and refugees and to be frank we don't even know who is who and have estimated numbers at this point. Why do we have to transport people to Germany and find out there that they are not even refugees then retunr them back? It is not fair on them and not fair on the EU. And a side note..... it would be great to see some balanced reporting in the media as well and not making the situation worse by picking on certain countries like Hungary when to be honest nobody can handle the situation.

681	"I agree that some contries are better equipeed at dealing with the situation but looking at the news from Germany they are seem to struggle at this point too. Anyway, my point is that a clear message should be sent that only refugees can go to Germany and the EU which may discourage people to embark on this journey at all. If they see that somehow getting to the EU will enable them to go to Germany they will try their luck. As much as I am aware of a train was stopped many times in Germany by pulling the emergency handle and migrants jumpped off the train and disappeared. How can you make sure that they will go back then? I still think that we can bring the ""equipment"" to the people rather than the people to the equipment. Costs less time and money. I am not sure if it was a really a terrorist or not so I cannot comment on that, I heard about it but I am really not sure how reliable the info is. There is certainly a risk and that is why I am saying stop everyone where they are and find out there and then. If the EU is one unit it doesn't matter so the funds and resources can go to where the problem is. I also think that Germany should take more responisbilty about the situation due to the message that was sent out (funnily enough that was a rather vague statment which now can be altered according to the situation - but lets move on about it) Than it is possible to talk about quotas and numbers. On Verdans point what I can see is that the communication between member states are really poor, everyone included, and this issue is highlighted it big time."

707	1. There are 49 countries where the majority of people are Muslim. There are only 7 countries that have a major portion of their laws under Sharia: Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Brunei. So the majority of muslim countries do not have Sharia law and those that do do not have full out Sharia. 2. There is no one type of muslim. Same as there is no one type of Jew, Christian or Atheist. There are moderates, liberals and radicals. Pretty much all the ground troops fighting ISIS are muslim and nearly all the people that ISIS kills are muslim. As shown above, the majority of countries do not have Sharia law so the majority of muslims are not radicals. So there is no one group of muslims. Same as the fact that there is no one group of christians. Not all christians are part of the KKK. Although all KKK members are Christian. 3. The west have been at the forefront of giving power to the radicals. They financed and supported al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. They illegal occupied iraq, a country that had no presence of al qaeda or ISIS before the invasion, putting in policies that banned pretty much the army, councillors and police officers allowing for al qaeda to enter Iraq and cause havoc. The west continually supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest purchasers of western weapons and therefore they are the untouchables. The middle east has payed the price for this. There are many factors that have resulted in the mess were are in and the West's middle east policy is one of them. 4. Most religious books contain practices that may not be applicable to our society. For example within the old testament: Murder Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged from Israel. (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT) Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death. (Exodus 21:15 NAB) Sex Slaves - check out Exodus 21:7-11 NLT The majority of all muslims believe that some parts of the quran are specific to past events and should not be applied to today. A lot is story telling. The same thing applies to Christianity and Judaism. So, similar to most Jews and Christians, Muslims also live their lives not adhering to these things. There are 2.8bn muslims. If they all thought that suicide bombing is a duty against the infidels then our world wouldn't exist and there would only be 100% muslim countries with no minorities. I can only imagine what would happen if the Christian Spanish inquisition or the crusades occurred today and was picked up by social media and shown to us. It would cause a shitsorm and Christians would be the target of hate groups. All we would see and talk about is Christian terrorism.	Acceptable speech	Acceptable	No target	migrants

Jordan and Lebanon are tiny tiny countries. http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52893#.Vnue_UK0m20 This is not how you describe settled darling. 36% of those entering Europe are children and women. But in your eyes even muslim children are violent. We all know that there are more men entering because the route to europe is risky with lots of people dying.

My dad wasn't too pleased with Quran school and he had a good reason. He didn't want me brainwashed into extreme Islam. I see why, those people are horrible and their ideals are best left for the stone age. My dad believed in the freedom of every being. My dad never told my mom what to do. My mom doesn't cover and she works full time, not a house wife. I was taught to be independent, taught how to drive by my dad, was encouraged to work and to make my own decisions. I respect other people's beliefs and sexualities. My friends consist of many different backgrounds and beliefs. I'm friends with an atheist, bisexual, gay, lesbian, and transgender. I even enjoy conversations with this very religious Christian. To me they aren't those labels, they are just people whom I enjoy being with. My sister goes to a Christian University and has made friends with a nun. Everyone should have the right to belive what they want and no one should force any believe on them. So tell me, am I not western enough? You can't look at life through horse blinders. There are bad and good people everywhere.

AND: It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “…Whoever follows a path in pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise...

839	"As Croatia collapsed within 1 day, again Hungary has to solve the chaos. Now we must build up the fence till the Slovenian border as we did it at border of Serbia. Croatia is carrying the illegal immigrants to Hungary (as Serbia did it before) - daily more than 10 000 immigrants. Croatia doesn't defend its border, they don't deserve the membership of the EU. That's the Southern Slav mentality. (when they should do something, they don't do anything - as it happened so many times in the history) Hungary is the only country that keeps the rule of Schengen. We register and supply the illegal immigrants. We ensure that there isn't humanitarian catastrophie. The European Union let us again alone. It takes daily 1 billion Hungarian forint but we don't get any support from the EU. As the fence will be ready from Serbia to Slovenia, Hungary closes the border again and nobody will enter to us. Approximately 2000 Hungarian soldiers are building the fence and 3000 police officers look after the order. It would be nice if you reader from England, Germany, France and from all the countries of the world, never forget which country was the only tower against the illegal muslim horde! Don't believe to your press that is constantly crying for the ""refuggess""! They are constantly lying to you day to day! Greetings from Hungary!"	Background offensive	Offensive	Topic	migrants
840	Hy. I am a hungarian and please, lets clear something. Hungary receive the migrants for months (4000-11 000 people per day). We give them water, food (which they dash against our policemans), blankets, clothes, medicines, toys. We also showed the disney tale for the kids in the East-Railway Station. Many hungarian voluntaries and policemans help them, but unfortunately nobody see these pictures in west. Yes, the government built a fence, because the migrants arrived ILLEGAL through the GREEN BORDER. The authorities could’t check them and catch the smugglers. Besides, the migrants trampled down the fieldlands, so they caused serious damages for the farmers. Please, don’t forget, the registration points are still OPEN. However, the migrants don’t want register. They don’t give fingerprint and many of them throw away their papers. They would like to go Germany immediately without any papers and become angry when they have to wait a few hours (or a day) for the next train. This situation cause the most conflicts with the police. Greece, Italy, Croatia don’t try register the migrants (maybe Slovenia do something). Now, IT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. Hungary is the single country, which keep the schengen’ s rules. This is our responsibility. Currently, Croatia transport thousands of migrants with buses to the hungarian border. Yes, we take over them. We need to work TOGETHER. Please, stop blame Hungary for everything. Thank you. :)	Background offensive	Offensive	Topic	migrants

Then again, your elected governments have failed you spectatcuarly and are ultimately to blame for decades of mismanagment. How about you take it up with your government for failing to correctly tax the rich and actually seeing the state gets the money and put an end to the fakelaki system and the vastly overblown beaureaucracy amongst other things when the shit really started to hit the fan? And can you seriously expect the taxpayers of the EU states to keep coughing up money for Greece without reform? Just go on as before?

852	"I agree Vedran, but that is a bit like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted out and run through all your neighbours corn fields... My real solution would be to make the refugees do what they are supposed to do. The countries in eastern Europe, such as Croatia, Hungary etc are now in a no-win situation. If they follow international law, they are required to register every refugee as they cross the border. Once registered the relevant State assumes responsibilities for their general welfare - but the refugee is not then free to move on somewhere ""better"", so the State is potentially stuck with a crisis of it's own. However, the UN foresaw that problem way back in the day, and came up with resettlement - where nations agree to legally relocate refugees away from the over-burdened countries - opening up the option of transfer to USA, Australia etc. Now, ideally this would have happened before that poor boy got washed up on the beach, but it didn't - instead the world reacted, Merkel opened her mouth to invite everyone in, and then slammed the door in their faces. Now, back to the no-win situation facing eastern Europe... they should close their borders and register people - but then the world says they are inhumane. Even the UN are criticising them for (apparently) doing the right thing. They can't send the refugees back down the line to Turkey, and the next country up the line won't let them in... So whereas my post was in jest, some of it was actually the most realistic solution ... let the ""refugees"" currently on the move get to the countries equipped to process them but then do everything as it should have been done in the first place, namely register them and resettle as necessary (or call on the UN to help with the financial burden of camps etc.) At the same time stop the initial migration away from the official camps in bordering countries. And above all, remember if they want to be thought of as refugees, the plan should be to get them all back home to syria again... not building a new permanent life somewhere ""better""."

883	"1. I don't worship a pedophile. I respect and adore a prophet. Placing him into the category of a pedophile is beyond pathetic as he lived 1400 YEARS. 1400 years. People change in 1400 years. In the future, people would call us pedophiles for marrying people at the age of 20-28. That's the problem that you don't seem to understand. It was a norm to marry women at a young age. How can I call someone who lived more than a thousand years ago a rapist if it was a normal thing for EVERY human on the planet at that point to marry young females? Marriage is also a choice in islam. I'm a young woman yet my parents don't force me to marry at a young age. THAT is culture. A culture that has ruined the true image of islam by mixing its own blend to make islam look ""nice"" for them. But it isn't. 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war). However, that doesn't mean that a man can just randomly go get a second wife just like that. He has to ask his first wife and if she agrees (nowadays a i doubt that), he has to go through his finances so he knows that he's able to take care of a second. I doubt even more that there will be a woman that would want to share their love for a husband with another which makes it harder for a man to find a second wife. If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. Also, nowehere in the quran does it state how many husbands a woman can have but yes it does say a man can have 4 wives. For women, it would mean that she could marry as many as she pleases (though WHY would a woman wanna do that? I don't wanna have more than one husband and I know for certain that we would enjoy putting our efforts and love for one guy and not many and men would not enjoy having to share their love for one woman but some regions in the world have different norms (which i'm TRYING TO POINT OUT because the prophet and those who lived with him existed in a different time with DIFFERENT norms). Today we have somewhat the same norms but because of differences in timeline, we change alot for the better but know that we can follow the same norms. It's just that it's very important to make everyone and God happy . 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah.

If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. 3. You want to know the positives that Islam has brought 30 YEARS FROM NOW? You weren't being clear with your point as you challenged me to state the positive things that Islam has brought to the west. I did but you are so reluctant to holding on to your opinion because 30 years ago, many ARABIC countries, not islamic, ARABIC countries decided to rebel against their leaders, resulting in new leaders and more rebellious groups are formed to overthrow the leaders. They use anything that is necessary to take down the leader and when they do, they have NO IDEA on how to govern at all. Are these muslims? Of course not. If strongly hold on to your actions and blame people when clearly there were better options (peace deals), then you're not a muslim. You're an idiot. Ignorant idiots. 4. The BIGGEST issue that I have with people criticizing isla m is that they point out issues with countries and how they govern. Both sides (the west AND ""muslim"" countries) are doing everything they can, knowingly and unknowingly sabbotaging the religion that once stated that through knowledge and peace, there will be victory. The problem isn't interely muslim countries, it's nationalism. It still exists and is the main reason why many have such hatred and rage towards others. even countries considered ""muslim"" have a grudge against each other (look at Saudi Arabia and Iran). Islam is a religion that unifies people, wether colour, race, sex, age or ethnicity. All it takes is an open mind and you might learn things beyond the screams and echoes from the media. I have watched Christianity and its history, I have seen the issues with Zionism vs Judaism, I have heard of people who believe in Buddhism but do terrible acts against others. WE humans are responsible for OUR actions and what we bring forth to our religion. Islam is always waiting for people to listen to it but many have always glared behind for other things and sometimes turned their cheeks. I CAN BRING a good image of Islam and I can also BRING a bad image of it aswell but Islam as a whole is never changed. It stays the same. Only I can become distorted or bad. THAT is why you see muslims bombing themselves and killing in the name of God: They are enraged, confused and don't know about Islam. When you live in a place where foreigners (US) have bombed, destroyed unity, taken their properties and placed terrible leaders there, what are the odds that you end up becoming confused of the situation, just like many, and do everything necessary to take back the good times. Suddenly you get it back but what CAN you do? You don't know how to govern, you know how to fight. All rebellious groups start out well, fighting for justice and then suddenly along the way, they become confused and even mad with power and strength that God has given them, only to use it to hurt others and blame God for that. There is a problem in these places but to solve it, PEOPLE NEED TO STOP BALING EVERYTHING ON ISLAM AND GET THEIR BUTTS OFF OF THESE PLACES and I'm talking mainly about the US.

936	".. Uhm ""my country/citizenship/nationslity/identity"" is Canadian, not Greek. I'm glad you showed everyone how you think in labels and racist terms. For your information, I'm 3rd generation Canadian actually, and using a Greek name on Facebook is because I teach Greek and English and don't want students finding me easily on Facebook, and secondarily because of my ancestry which you were so eager to observe duh. The fact that you actually decided to publicly attack and deride Greeks for what their country is going through regarding their economy, just because you ASSumed I'm Greek (as though Greeks don't have a right to tell people what is objectively true or not just because, as you said their economy is in tatters), when in actuality we are talking about: a) refugees and Syrians fleeing their country into Turkey where they are safe from war and b) their illegal immigration into Greece and Europe, and c) whether the media should continue to label illegal immigrants as refugees, is utterly schizophrenic in your part my friend and proves exactly how terribly messed up your way of thinking really is. As for Greeks, since you mention, given the fact that about 10,000 have died due to the economic crisis, and over 200,000 have legally immigrated due to the economic downturn also, that's all the more reason not to compound the Greek problems and incapacity to offer help by burdening Greece with the largest number of illegal immigrants in Europe. I seriously doubt that American people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that French people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that Greeks are to blame for the mistakes and betrayal if their politicians and the stupid laws they pass and agreements they made and borrowed money they used. You are a dumb, ignorant bastard. I hope all the ""refugees"" come to your posh neighborhood in Austria. Then you will stfu. You are a bigoted racist. ==== Canada will accept mostly immigrants. The media, and morons like you, will keep calling them refugees because it's a sexier news headline. Enjoy Vienna built only in Greek style architecture. One of the most racist and Nazi cities in Europe, and the only country in Europe that has received the LEAST number of immigrants labeled refugees... It's easy for you to judge ask other countries.. I hope you are deported back to Britain by Austrian authorities so that your place is given to a Syrian family in need. They need it more than you do anyway, and have far more grounds to immigrate to Austria than you did, in your logic."	Other offensive	Offensive	Commenter	migrants

So why wouldn't you go to such a country who has the infrastructure to take you in and make use of your skills. Why would anyone stay in Hungary? have you seen how they have treated the refugees? Like animals. A couple of questions regarding Syrians being cowards that I hope you can answer: 1. Who are the Syrian people supposed to push out? Bashar/government? Al Qaeda? ISIS? or the hundred other rebel factions fighting? 2. Where are you supposed to get the money to buy the weapons? Did your grandparents find the weapons under their house or were they supplied by your government? 3. Would you keep your family under ISIS control while you are fighting? Would you take the risk that your child may be taken away at any moment or that an airstrike will come and kill the whole family? 4. Are all refugees leaving war cowards? Are Jews cowards for leaving Germany? 5. ISIS knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians. 6. The government knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians.

They're fleeing poverty, war and dictatorial government, they're not a threat to us, all they bring is competition, which spurs the economy, innovation and a population boost, as long as the EU splits the load evenly these migrants/refugees will be a net gain for Europe, the way it's currently being managed though is that Germany will be overrun, fuelling tensions, spreading fear and causing problems, the burden needs to be shared for this to work.

Our Prime Minister is with his unusual move forced a little neighboring states to open their borders. Now we have no more problems - everything goes smoothly because we have a transit country for refugees ... but the easiest way was to attack us that we are inadequate and that we did not hold out for two days - we did not, it is true, because any state around us did not stick to our agreement.

1038	A refugee must ask for asylum in the first country where there is peace. If they continue to migrate to other countries, not having a valid travel document, crossing borders in fields rather than the official way, they become illegal migrants and according to laws should be treated that way and deported. Very simple. Tell me where there is war all the way from Turkey to Germany, Sweden, UK? You might say Kosovo, perhaps. Other than that there is no conflict and no reason not to ask for asylum. That being said - not only they are they illegal migrants but illegal economical migrants. Those who really need help of any kind are not these, but those who suffer in kemps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and even Egypt.	Background offensive	Offensive	Topic	migrants

1097	"So their story is tragic, indeed, but goes as follows: after war in their country they flee to the nearest safest place due to force majeure and seek refuge, for example in Turkey, where they also have an international legal status as refugees. Then, they don't like it there, for whatever reason, even though they are perfectly safe as refugees, and decide to illegally immigrate and walk or are driven by smugglers for 1700 km across Turkey's land to subsequently cross the sea into Greece, putting in danger their own and their children's lives by bringing more unnecessary treacherous hardship and toil unto themselves, utterly and wholly of their own accord. Meantime the media still calls them euphemistically ""refugees"" ad infinitum, long after they have chosen to do away with their legal status as refugees given that they immigrate illegally to other counties without being in any immediate danger, in fact even though they do not qualify as ""refugees"" in any sense of the word once they cross Turkey's border into Greece, neither in the legal sense under all international treaties, nor in the etymological sense; simply because for at least 1700-1900 km of land maybe way more and a stretch of rough sea with the help of an illegal smuggler whom they themselves paid, they illegally immigrate into a country two or ten borders seat from the one they had initially sought refuge into. So the small question is why are the media still all calling them refugees after they reach Greece, when CLEARLY BLATANTLY they are NOT in any sense of the word, legal or etymological or otherwise (compassion is not an excuse for bad journalism of forging skewed opinion shaping public perception). Are you saying that they are running away from dire danger while they are in Turkey, to which they initially sought refuge to, qualifying the use of the term as refugees due to force majeure into Greece? And the big question is: there are over 2.5 billion people with similar or more tragic circumstances. Should they be allowed to immigrate illegally to any country they please? What about Somalian children and people in general? They actually have it worse than Syrians in all respects, plus they don't make demands for halal food. Wanting their life back which was destroyed by war is understandable. But so do another 2.5 billion people around the world with similar or worse circumstances. Should they all be allowed to immigrate illegally into Europe just because the media arbitrarily label them as refugees long after they are no longer refugees nor, in veritable fact, seeking refuge into safety not running away from any danger, perceived or real?"

1098	David, your response has left me bewildered due to the tone of immaturity and I believe you don't understand what I'm talking about. I meant the task of going to school. Education does change ideals, and like I said, it's what I have seen work. Like I also said, I don't have a solution. I'm just sharing what I've seen. My mom started out in a very religious, though not extreme, home. She was the first girl to go to school in her family. After going to school, her view became more modern. She broke off from the idea that women are only supposed to be serving men. I'm sorry if that's not the response you wanted. The current situation is a delicate one. Handle it the wrong way and you end up creating more extremists instead of diminishing their numbers. To answer your next question: I do believe all nations have a right to protect their citizens from any sort of threat. But how to deal with that threat is another issue. All in all.. Just because I am Muslim doesn't mean I am equiped to provide solutions for this situation or any similar situation . I can only tell you my experience. I can only say I don't want to see anyone get hurt. It's ignorant of me to say that but that's just how I feel.	Acceptable speech	Acceptable	No target	migrants

Your religion requires total submission, shames women, doesn't allow them to make free choices. You haven't given me any positives about Islam, you have referred to very far past, again what has Islam brought to the west in last 30 years apart from misery, honour killings, bombings, rapes etc. Even Salman Rashdie had fatwa issued against him because he criticized Islam.

1142	Maria Szpunar the reason were talking about Muslims at all really is that they have just forced their way half way up Europe against any international law , they come from war torn areas, we have seen them fighting in the streets with police and rioting , we have seen the Islamic flag flown in Germany again when the Syrian Migrants were fighting with German police, we have seen them fighting in the streets of Europe against the afgans a culture clash there , this is in the space of a week, what your seeing is an invasion of Europe nothing less, by who? Refugees, no to be a refugee you have to stop at the first safe country and seek asylum that would have been Greece or Italy.if you proceed you are a migrant and if you have not got papers , passports or any id you are an illegal migrant, however as Ty Royce Weldon says they are the single greatest threat that the western world have 9/11 to remind you in your country, brits killed on a beach in Tunsia recently bombings and be headings, As you say there is bad in each culture very true but this lot rank in top place for total disregard to life did I mention the use of chemical weapons , If this were America I am sure the Americans would want to vet these people before taking them into their country, but in fact they are better to remain in their own cultural land and should really be taken in by other Mislim countries and not be given out handouts and maps to the promised land they already have it its called Syria and as we see all these pictures of a males forcing their way up Europe like a riot mob when ever stopped and asked for ID , they should be fighting for their home land to forge a future for their families , a great majority of these peope need sending back to a safe area and if refugee? go through the right international procedures .but this is just plain lawlessness.

1184	@ Delfina Jones, three things: 1. Extreme Ethnocentrism to the point of disregarding others' opinions and putting yours at highest 2. Insulting people's opinions to raise your own to prove you're right 3. The Islam faith is one like Christianity where Christianity dominates a lot of Europe and the western Countries in which Christianity went through destruction and death to get where it is today (referencing back to religious laws back then in European history, the Crusades, colonization and teaching the beliefs of Christianity using it for manipulation, etc). The Islamic religion is going through a similar scenario of extremists like Christianity did as well as probably all religions (over generalizing but you get the point, hopefully). Many are dying yes, and modernization has let those extremists cause a lot more damage globally however, what must be kept in mind is that there are some who do need help. Ignoring a problem won't make it go away. Yes, countries like yours have internal issues to solve but without the world, globalization from countries other than yours, the country you currently live in wouldn't have developed into the way it is today. Which is most likely pretty modernized. Congratulations, you won the lottery ticket of privilege. Unfortunately others didn't. And you most likely won, as well as many of us, from immigration from the origin of our countries. The reason of immigration may be different for all of us but it's certain that we moved for the reason of a better life. If your family was denied to immigrate, you could've been in the Syrian's shoes or your descendants would have faced more issues while your origin county developed possibly ending your family line, meaning you wouldn't have been born. Try stepping into others' shoes and keep an open mind. Thank you	Acceptable speech	Acceptable	No target	migrants

With Syrian and Kurdish forces holding the border east of the Euphrates, the Afrin-Jarabulus corridor is the only remaining conduit for supplies bound for terrorists in Syria to pass…..When this corridor is closed and supplies cut off, ISIS, Nusra, and all associated NATO-backed factions will atrophy and die as the Syrian military restores order across the country… With that support being cut off and the prospect of these militants being eradicated, the true sponsors behind this conflict are moving more directly and overtly to salvage their failed conspiracy against the Syrian state.

1233	"2. Though islam is a religion that shows similar patterns to judaism and Christianity, the religion was giving in clear message that 1. it came in peace:The worshippers of the All-Merciful are they who tread gently upon the earth, and when the ignorant address them, they reply, “Peace!” ""Quran: 25:63 and: And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say: “To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we do not seek out the ignorant. Quran: 28:55 (the first letters to ever come from quran, sent to humanity was ""READ!"" = KNOWLEDGE) 2. it was finalizing what came from the previous religions but also adding alot of details that will make it almost IMPOSSIBLE to be corrupted (memorizing by all muslims, scientific facts, stories from the past, more laws and the way it's written is just not HUMAN.

Hungary should be commended for showing people that its laws must be respected and that it is absurd to claim to be a 'refugee' and simultaneuosly 'force' (battling police, even if unarmed) your way into another country ... the real refugees from the Syrian civil war are in the refugee camps of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and deserve all the help necessary to provide them with the basic necessities of life and a chance to immigrate to another country by LEGAL immigration or return to their own country once the fighting has stopped and international assistance in rebuilding that country should be generously provided ... not least by the countries who took advantage of Syria's domestic problems (to reduce pressure on Israel to make peace with the Palestinians) and by their meddling (sending mercenaries) prolonged the fighting and caused many civilian deaths and most of the refugee problem ...

1248	BBC just stop lying in general about these countries and the crisis! I'm getting really fed up with this one-sided disgusting propaganda! I know it's not strictly a response to this video, but please let me say this. These people (I'm perfectly aware that not all of them, but most) are very agressive, when they don't get what they want. They demonstrated it very well at the Hungarian-Serbian border two days ago. BBC always shows crying children. But the fact is they're crying, because they are used in order to get sympathy and when they get tossed around they just get scared of the yelling and agression. They're crying because the migrants' actions make them cry. Not the Hungarians, Croatians or Serbians, The migrants always use babies or little children as shields. How can they do this to those poor kids? And they're called 'refugees' by BBC...yeah some refugees these are.... There are leaders among them who tell the crowd what to do via megaphones. Yeah obviously when you're fleeing from danger you must carry megaphones with you in your backpacks...yeah right. And the fact that BBC is assisting this Trojan horse move is outrageous!

1270	"Put aside economy and what ours politicians talking, every country has that problem... We all know that this kind of refugees travel throught the countries just like that... even german chancellor knows that.... I'm or we are not contradicting - You forgot Eszter that before you close border there were agreement that Croatia will be transit country ( are we?) and that you all the time untill you close yor border WERE TRANSIT, no one around you made a problem to you for refugees because we heard all kind of news from Hungary, good and bad, register and not register - but, I repeat - you were transit all the time. Croatia is not in the same situation - we are surounded with countries who close border and not allow refugee crossing... EU just can't expect of us to do job what we all had to do from the beginning and we can't accumulate refugees in Croatia because suddenly all of you find out that is a bit too much of them. I'm contradicting? Europe is thought to cheat Croatia again and turn Croatia into a ""collection center for refugees"" - because what else will mean close all borders around us and suddenly the EU rule - no new corridors? You forgot - Hungary had open coridor during the long period before closing border!!!! I have a right not to be contradicting because I'm not - I have the righ to be very angry. Solution for a problem is - all states can open border and one rute can go through Hungary, one through Croatia... or we all can help Greece to close land and sea borders or.... there is many solution but no will. Eszter... Hungary as a country is a great, I really have nothing against you and I just even admire border act you done but this just not right toward Croatia.... We are also knows read and listen when foreign politicians or common people talk and we know add up 2+2... Closed border around us, EU rule - no new refugee coridor... we must be stupid enough to not figured out what that all mean!

1272	Personally, I think CIA agents triggered the civil war in Syria. America wants to weaken Assad and by that weaken Russia as well, since Russia supports Assad. Russia needs that harbour which he rents from Assad. So they're 'friends' if you will. America's only interested in the oil there and weakening Russia. Furthermore if there's any kind of war, then America can sell weapons as well and it's a huge business. But I agree with you on that the superpowers should've left the Middle East alone!
